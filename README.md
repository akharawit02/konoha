# Konoha 🦊

A simple way for people to search for Anime/Manga characters 🧙‍♂️

## Process and Goal 💪

Konoha was designed in Figma 🖌️

My main goal was to build something small with GraphQL and Tailwind 😄

I tried Playwright in the beginning for the E2E Tests, but didn't like it. 😐

I must say, I really enjoyed working with Tailwind, it's awesome 🎉.

I do use URQL at work, but didn't know it was that easy to get started with, it was great 🥰.

## Installation 🛠️

After cloning the project, you just need to run `yarn` 🔧

## Tools ⚒️

- Building: React, TypeScript, Twind, Tailwind, URQL, GraphQL :sunglasses:
- E2E Tests: Cypress :metal:

## License :nerd_face:

Built by Tiger Abrodi under MIT license :two_hearts: 😘.
